# burp-oauther
based on [burp-oauth](https://github.com/dnet/burp-oauth), this version of the tool has a configuration screen and does not require recompiling whenever keys, tokens, secrets are changed.

As this is ultimately using [signpost](https://github.com/mttkay/signpost), it is also limited to the [OAuth Core 1.0a standard](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a).
